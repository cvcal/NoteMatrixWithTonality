##What are one or more things that you like about this project? What's exciting?

I think that the form of input for the language is incredibly interesting, and makes for music creation that is fun, eloquent and also relatively simple to create. It is very exciting when a language can be used by non-professionals in the domain and yet be exciting and fun to use.

 I think that this form of input has a lot of potential if there is enough time given to really explore different ways that the user can interact with the grid that you plan to use. 


##What's the balance of language design vs sheer programming / engineering in this project?

I feel like this is going to be a very programming heavy project given the GUI elements that you hope to use, and also the high dependence of visuals. In addition, having to learn the APIs to use and making them all work together will be a bit of work. While I'm sure you'll do just fine with these challenges, I hope that you take the time to really think more about the actual language part of the project. 



##How can the project maximize the time spent on language design? How to focus on interesting, possibly new ideas?

This is an area where I hope you spend more time, as I feel that the addition of colors that match to tone might not be an ambitious enough extension to the tonematrix audio tool. What other kinds of things can you add to this DSL that will truly make it unique? I like that you mention giving users of your DSL the ability to define the dimensions of the grid, what kinds of things does this allow for? Why would a user choose to change the dimensions? Could this possibly be used to define tempo? 

Another idea that you mention is somehow stringing together squares in the matrix to make the tones last longer. Have you considered other ways that the user can interact with the matrix square? What if you took into account how long a square was held to represent how the long the tone was held? 

Have you thought about other elements of music that could somehow be defined using your DSL? Things like how loud a note is compared to other, maybe the octave. Anything to add tools to the DSL that aren't already available in tonematrix. 



##What are some interesting language design questions that the work will have to answer? In other words, what are the design challenges? Which design problems' solutions are you looking forward to hearing about at the end of the project?

I'm really excited to see how you are able to make your DSL unique and different from previous DSLs like tonematrix. With such an interesting input method that you are working with, the interesting design questions that you're currently facing is how to make use of relatively simple input, in the form of selecting square in a matrix, and communicating a lot about music. Providing a breadth of tools while still allowing the DSL to be simple enough for someone not educated in music theory to use and build more sophisticated musical pieces can be difficult.


##What are the primitives in this language?

Primitives are the simplest elements available in the programming language. In the case of NoteMatrixWithTonality, I would say that dimensions of the matrix, square in the matrix, then color and tone of square are primitives. The program seems to be built from these base elements based on how you described your DSL. 


##Do you know of any libraries, languages, or projects that might help this project?

My project will also be dependent on visuals and sound, and the libraries that I've been looking into that may be helpful are [Java Sound API](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/sound/) and [ScalaFX](https://code.google.com/p/scalafx/).
