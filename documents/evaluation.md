# Tonatrix Preliminary evaluation


## What works well? What are you particularly pleased with?





## What could be improved? 

**For example, how could the user's experience be better? How might your 
implementation be simpler or more cohesive?**



## Evaluation Plan results. 

**Which tools have you used to evaluate the quality of your design? What have you learned from these evaluations? Have you made any significant changes as a result of these tools, the critiques, or user tests?**



## Where did you run into trouble and why? 

**For example, did you come up with some syntax that you found difficult to 
implement, given your host language choice? Did you want to support multiple 
features, but you had trouble getting them to play well together?**




## What's left to accomplish before the end of the project?
